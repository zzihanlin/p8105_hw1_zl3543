```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```

```{r}

# Problem 1

# Load necessary libraries
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)

# Load the penguins dataset
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

```

The data set contains `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns. The mean flipper length is `r round(mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 2)` mm.

```{r}
# Remove rows with missing values in the bill_length_mm or flipper_length_mm columns
penguins_clean <- na.omit(penguins[, c("bill_length_mm", "flipper_length_mm", "species")])

# Create the scatterplot
penguins_plot <- ggplot(data = penguins_clean, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Scatterplot of Flipper Length vs Bill Length",
    x = "Bill Length (mm)",
    y = "Flipper Length (mm)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Display the plot
penguins_plot

```

```{r}

# Save the scatterplot to the project directory
ggsave("scatterplot_penguins.png", plot = penguins_plot, width = 6, height = 4)

```

```{r}

# Problem 2

# Load tidyverse for data manipulation
library(tidyverse)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Create the data frame
df <- data.frame(
  numeric_vector = rnorm(10), # Random sample from standard Normal distribution
  logical_vector = rnorm(10) > 0, # Logical vector indicating values > 0
  character_vector = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"), # Character vector
  factor_vector = factor(sample(c("Low", "Medium", "High"), 10, replace = TRUE)) # Factor vector with 3 levels
)

# View the data frame
df

```

```{r}

# Take the mean of each variable
numeric_mean <- mean(pull(df, numeric_vector))       # Works for numeric vectors
logical_mean <- mean(pull(df, logical_vector))       # Works for logical vectors (TRUE = 1, FALSE = 0)
character_mean <- try(mean(pull(df, character_vector)))  # Will fail for character vectors
factor_mean <- try(mean(pull(df, factor_vector)))    # Will fail for factor vectors

# Print the results
cat("Mean of numeric vector:", numeric_mean, "\n")
cat("Mean of logical vector:", logical_mean, "\n")
cat("Mean of character vector:", character_mean, "\n")
cat("Mean of factor vector:", factor_mean, "\n")

# Numeric vector: The mean works correctly, as expected.
# Logical vector: The mean works and represents the proportion of TRUE values.
# Character vector: Taking the mean of a character vector is not meaningful and results in an error.
# Factor vector: Taking the mean of a factor is also not meaningful because factors are categorical data, not numeric.

# Coerce factor to numeric and calculate the mean
factor_mean_coerced <- mean(as.numeric(pull(df, factor_vector)))
cat("Mean of coerced factor vector:", factor_mean_coerced, "\n")

```

```{r}

# Apply as.numeric to logical, character, and factor variables
logical_as_numeric <- as.numeric(pull(df, logical_vector))  # Convert logical to numeric
character_as_numeric <- as.numeric(pull(df, character_vector))  # Convert character to numeric
factor_as_numeric <- as.numeric(pull(df, factor_vector))  # Convert factor to numeric
